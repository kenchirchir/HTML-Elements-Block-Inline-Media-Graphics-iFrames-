HTML Elements Guided Activity
Welcome! This activity will help you practice block vs inline elements, media (audio & video), graphics (img, svg, canvas), and iframes in HTML.

Follow the steps carefully and commit your progress after each section.

Learning Goals
Understand the difference between block and inline elements.
Use media elements to add audio and video.
Create graphics with <img>, <svg>, and <canvas>.
Embed external content using an <iframe>.
Part 1: Block vs Inline Elements
Create a file called block-inline.html.
Add a paragraph (<p>) with some text. Inside it, place:
A <strong> word (inline element).
A <span> with a different background color.
Add two block elements (<div> and <section>) and give them borders to see how they stack.
Part 2: Media (Audio & Video)
Create a file called media.html.
Add:
An audio player using <audio controls> with an MP3 file.
A video player using <video controls width="320"> with an MP4 file.
Add a track (<track>) to your video for captions.
Part 3: Graphics (Image, SVG, Canvas)
Create a file called graphics.html.
Add:
An <img> showing any image (local or online).
An inline SVG circle
A canvas and draw a rectangle inside it using JavaScript
Part 4: iFrame
Create a file called child.html in your project folder.

Add a heading, a short paragraph, and optionally an image to make it look like a simple webpage.
Create another file called iframe.html.

Inside it, use an <iframe> to embed your child.html page.
Give the iframe a width, height, and a border so you can clearly see it on the page.
